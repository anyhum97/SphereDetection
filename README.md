# SphereDetection
<p>
 Sphere detection algorithm:<br>

 <p>
 Environment:<br><br>
 1. Programming language could be C/C++/OpenCL/CUDA.<br>
 2. Code compatible with Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 2017.<br>
 3. Third-party libraries only Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), OpenMesh (http://www.openmesh.org/).<br>
 </p>

 <p>
 Task description:<br><br>

 Develop an application that receives a polygonal mesh with known topology, without single-disconnected points, maximal number of spheres, and fits the given number of spheres in the input mesh.<br>
 Additional parameters could be RMS distance threshold from the detected spheres.<br>
 The spheres can have different radius.<br>
 The application outputs the center and radius for each sphere.<br>
 </p>

 <p>
 Additional requirements:<br><br>
 - For a given example mesh algorithm should fit 5 spheres in less then 1 second (excluding I/O operations) on CPU Core i7 3Ghz)<br>
 - Production-grade code<br>
 - Cross-platform solution<br>
